    Where are you<br> 
I can't find you<br>
Please tell me where you are<br><br>

 you're always in my heart<br>
 Ever since the day<br>
 We broke apart<br><br>

I don't know where to start from<br>
You left me no clue<br>
But I'll find you whatever it takes<br>
Cuz you I could never forsake<br><br>

Wish I could go back in time<br>
To change our fate<br>
And make you mine<br>
But that'd be a good reality<br>
Those thoughts are just lethality<br><br>

Yeah!<br><br>
I know I could never take back all the shit I  said to you <br>
All these hoes in my dms made you insecure<br>
Wrap your legs around me <br>
And knock me to my sense<br>
Once again once again yeah!<br><br>

Where are you <br>
I can't find you<br>
Please tell me where you are<br><br>

 you're always in my heart<br>
  Ever since the day<br>
   We broke apart<br><br>

I realised my mistakes<br>
Now I just want you back instead<br>
You can't go away from me<br>
Without you I'm nobody<br><br>


Wish I could go back in time<br>
To change our fate<br>
And make you mine<br>
But that'd be a good reality<br>
Those thoughts are just lethality<br><br>

Yeah!<br><br>
No matter Where you are<br>
I'll be standing waiting for you<br>
Hope you change your mind<br>
I'd be glad to have you back<br>
Help me get out from this crap<br>
Turned me insomniac<br>
I'm crawling on a racetrack<br><br>

Where are you <br>
I can't find you<br>
Please tell me where you are<br><br>

 you're always in my heart<br>
  Ever since the day<br>
   We broke apart<br><br>
   
I don't know where to start from<br>
You left me no clue<br>
But I'll find you whatever it takes<br>
Cuz you I could never forsake<br><br>

Wish I could go back in time<br>
To change our fate<br>
And make you mine<br>
But that'd be a good reality<br>
Those thoughts are just lethality<br><br>

Yeah!<br><br>
I ain't givin up yet<br>
On your marks get set<br>
I'm racin like a jet<br>
Hold me tight<br>
I know I'm right<br>
I'll find you by daylight<br>
