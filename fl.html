    I don't know if I could take it anymore<br>
    Cuz you're the one I've been looking for<br><br>
    
    Baby come let's fall in love<br>
    I will never let you go away from me<br><br>
    
    Hmm......<br><br>
    
    Every time I look at the mirror <br>

    I see you standing next to me<br>
    
    Sitting across me at the table <br>
    you're Lookin right into my eyes <br><br>
    
    Is it that I'm going crazy<br>
    Or you just playing with my mind<br>
    I can never end this feeling <br>
    till I get to see you around<br><br>
    
    Hmm.....<br><br>
    
    Love me once baby<br>
     love me twice<br>
     I keep on falling for you<br>  
     each and every time<br>
    
    Love me back baby, love me back<br>
    Kiss me back baby till I'm out of breath<br>
    
    I don't wanna world without you girl<br>
    Cuz you're the only reason why I'm still alive<br><br>
    
    Hmm..
