You mess my mind<br>
You break my heart <br>
Now it's bleeding<br>
But I won't stop breathing<br>
Need to catch my breath and<br>
Fix myself<br>
I know I'd make it out of here alright<br>


Drugged up by your love <br>
I (never) never thought that you'd leave me here<br>
But I realised that you'd be (my) my worst<br>
 reality<br><br><br>


You mess my mind<br>
You break my heart <br>
Now I'm bleeding<br>
But I won't stop breathing<br>
Need to catch my breath and<br>
Fix myself<br>
I know I'd make it out of here alright<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


You fucked me up<br>
But I won't give up<br>
I ain't losing myself for a bitch like you<br>
<br>
You fucked me up<br>
But I won't give up<br>
I ain't losing myself for a bitch like you<br>
<br><br>


You mess my mind<br>
You break my heart <br>
Now it's bleeding<br>
But I won't stop breathing<br>
Need to catch my breath and<br>
Fix myself<br>
I know I'd make it out of here alright<br>
